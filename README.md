# gw-libretro

**gw-libretro** is a [libretro](http://www.libretro.com/) core that runs Game & Watch simulators.

It runs simulators converted from source code available in [MADrigal](http://www.madrigaldesign.it/sim/). Each simulator was converted with [pas2lua](https://github.com/leiradel/pas2lua), which was written specifically for this purpose.
